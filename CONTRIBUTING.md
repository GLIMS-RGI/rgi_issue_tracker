# How to contribute

Thank you for your help with the Randolph Glacier Inventory!

Report issues about the RGI datasets: https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgi_issue_tracker/issues 

Your feedback is highly appreciated! You'll need to be a [registered github user](https://github.com) to open or comment on an issue.

Here you can report issues about the latest **stable** RGI releases: **version 6.0 and version 7.0**.

To report an issue about GLIMS, see the [GLIMS issue tracker](https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/glims_issue_tracker). 

To report an issue about the actively developped RGI version (currently none), see the [rgi_scripts issue tracker](https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgi7_scripts). 

**In case of doubt, post it here and we will sort it out for you!**

Issues reported here will never be closed. They are here to **document known problems in the published datasets** (however, RGI 6.0 issues might have been fixed in RGI 7.0).
