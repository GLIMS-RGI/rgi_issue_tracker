# RGI issue tracker

This tracker documents problems identified in the RGI and reported by the community. Your feedback is highly appreciated!

You can report issues or suggest improvements to the RGI **version 6.0** and **version 7.0** here:  https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgi_issue_tracker/issues

Previously reported issues in RGI 6.0 that have been fixed in RGI 7.0 only carry the [RGI 6.0 label](https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgi_issue_tracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22RGI+6.0%22). 
If they still persist, both labels ([RGI 6.0 and RGI 7.0](https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgi_issue_tracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22RGI+6.0%22+label%3A%22RGI+7.0%22)) are attached. Issues that carry the [RGI 7.0 label](https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgi_issue_tracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22RGI+7.0%22) may be fixed in a future version of the RGI. 

You'll need to be a [registered github user](https://github.com) to open or comment on an issue.
