Your feedback is highly appreciated!

Report issues about the RGI: https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgi_issue_tracker/issues 

Here you can report issues about the latest **stable** RGI releases: **version 6.0 and version 7.0**. 
This list documents **known problems in the published datasets**. Issues in RGI 6.0 that have been fixed in 
RGI 7.0 only carry the RGI 6.0 label. Issues that carry the RGI 7.0 label are still present in RGI 7.0, and 
might be fixed in a future version of the RGI.
